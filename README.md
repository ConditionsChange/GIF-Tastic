# Info

This app loads various GIFs using the Giphy API onto the page. There are several buttons shown on the page that will return GIFs related to that topic. Once the GIFs load onto the page the user is able to play and pause the GIFs by clicking on them. The user is also allowed to add new buttons to the page by using the input field at the top of the page.

The default buttons revolve around a cartoon/tv show theme.
